  List of Applications.

If any of the applications is not available under _Neurodesk_ &rarr; _All applications_ in Neurodesk's start menu (notice that menu entries are sorted alphabetically), you might not be using the latest version of Neurodesktop.

Please use the platform-specific documentation page at https://www.neurodesk.org/docs/neurodesktop/getting-started/ to remove the current Neurodesktop ("Stopping neurodesktop" section down the page) and then re-install it ("Quickstart" section at the top of the page).

If you are using the Nectar Desktop Service, please let us know on the discussion forum (https://github.com/orgs/NeuroDesk/discussions, Github account required) and we will notify you when the application becomes available there.
