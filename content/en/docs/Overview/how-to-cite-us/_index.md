  How should I cite the tools I am using and Neurodesk itself?

## Citing tools

We recommend to cite the tool you are using with the version number and the builddate, because this guarantees full reproducibility. You can find this information here: https://www.neurodesk.org/applications/. It's also very important to cite the paper of the tool you are using and you find this information in the README.m of each tool, which you can find here (https://github.com/NeuroDesk/neurocontainers/tree/master/recipes) or when opening the application through the menu in Neurodesktop.

## Citing Neurodesk

You can cite the Neurodesk Preprint (https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/2022.12.23.521691v1) and if you used Neurodesktop you can also add the version that was used (e.g. v{{< params/neurodesktop/version >}}).

## Citing AEDAPT

If you used any EEG/MEG or electrophysiology tools, please link to the AEDAPT website: [https://www.aedapt.net/](https://www.aedapt.net/)
